# React Testing

Just me messing around with React/Webpack in code splitting mode. I don't really have any desire to create SPAs so this was a exercise in making different components that could be rendered independently. Luckily with webpack you can split out your code which makes this use case fairly easy to pull off.

## Development

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run server
```

I know there is some fresh reload/watch magic that I'm missing. Since this is just for reference for future me I'm not adding it.

## Disclaimer

Before you steal any of this, make sure you check the current date because all of this JavaScript stuff moves too fast for this to be still 100% correct.
